### Hi! Welcome to my GitHub home.

My name is Shivank Sharma and I am a Data Scientist. At present, I am working with Expedia Group to bring the world closer together with the power of Data and Technology. I am also pursuing my executive Masters in Data Science & Engineering from BITS, Pilani.

In the past, I have been part of teams using analytics to empower US Phamaceutical Firms deliver medicines for life-threatening conditions and Global Investment Banks to deliver quality service to investors.
